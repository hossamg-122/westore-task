                  provided by third-parties for use on or through WeStore
                  Services. For example, you can order products from third

                  product lines jointly with third-party businesses. You can
                  tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and
                  we share customers’ personal information related to those
                  transactions with that third-party.

                  services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail,
                  removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing
                  data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results
                  and links (including paid listings and links), processing
                  payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and
                  managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
                  third-party service providers have access to personal
                  information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
                  it for other purposes.
                </li>

                  <strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we continue to develop

                  services. In such transactions, customer information generally
                  is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject
                  to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy
                  (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in
                  the unlikely event that WeStore or substantially all of its
                  assets are acquired, customer information will of course be
                  one of the transferred assets.

                  is appropriate to comply with the law, court orders or
                  requirements of any government entity; enforce or apply
