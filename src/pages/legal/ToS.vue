              <p>WESTORE TERMS OF SERVICE</p>
              <p>Effective November 21, 2021</p>
              <p>Welcome to WeStore!</p>

              <p>
                These are the Terms of Use (“Terms”) that apply to your access
                and use of the WeStore.ai website and any mobile applications
                operated by WeStore Technology Limited DMCC and its affiliates
                (“WeStore”).
              </p>

              <p>
                WeStore offers an online platform connecting warehouses with
                storage space and delivery services available with customers
                seeking to use such storage space and delivery services
                (“WeStore Services”).
              </p>

              <p>
                The term “you” means the company or entity entering into these
                Terms, as well as any affiliates; you may also be referred to as
                a “Customer”. “Warehouse” means a user of the WeStore Services
                that creates a Warehouse account, which may use the account to
                create listings for available storage space at its facility(ies)
                or related storage, packing and delivery services (“Storage and
                Delivery Services”). If not available through a Warehouse,
                delivery services may be provided by other delivery service
                providers. “Customer” means a user of the WeStore Services that
                creates a Customer account, which may use the account to request
                Storage and Delivery Services via the WeStore Services.
              </p>

              <p>

                you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to all
                terms and conditions, you may not use the WeStore Services.

                or through WeStore for any purpose;

              <p>
                3.2 WeStore has the right to terminate any account, if it learns
                of a violation or suspected violation of any of the points under
                3.1, or for any reason it considers appropriate.
              </p>

              <p>4. Listings, Storage and Delivery Services</p>

              <p>
                4.1 When a Customer is interested in Storage and Delivery
                Services that match a warehouse listing, WeStore will send
                Warehouse a quotation (“Quotation”) with the pricing and details
                of the Customer’s products, number of pallets, requested
                services and storage and delivery requirements. Warehouse may
                accept or reject the Quotation for any reason. If Warehouse
                accepts the Quotation, Customer will receive details of the
                services and costs (“Service
              </p>
              <p>
                Order”) from WeStore. Storage and Delivery Services will then
                begin on the commencement date.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.2 Warehouse reserves the right to refuse any goods for storage
                if they do not conform to the description and quantity in the
                Quotation, or are dangerous or hazardous. Warehouse will inform
                WeStore about the refusal within 4 hours of receipt of such
                goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.3 WeStore is not responsible for any disputes between
                Warehouse and Customer regarding the availability or quality of
                the Storage and Delivery Services, or any other dispute between
                Warehouse and Customer whatsoever.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.4 WeStore does not make any representation or warranty
                regarding the accuracy of any listing. WeStore is not a broker
                and not the merchant of record of the Storage and Delivery
                Services. WeStore is only a platform for the connection of
                Customers and Warehouses, and offers payment processing as a
                convenience for the users of the WeStore Services.
              </p>
              <p>5. Fees and Payment</p>

              <p>
                5.1 After the end of each month, Warehouse will issue an invoice
                to WeStore for all services rendered to Customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                5.2 WeStore will issue an invoice to each Customer for that
                calendar month per the related Service Order(s), including any
                required VAT and service fees due to WeStore. The invoice must
                be paid within 7 days of the date of the invoice by either wire
                transfer or credit card. Unpaid fees are subject to an interest
                charge of 2.0% per month, or the maximum permitted by law,
                whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection, including
                court fees and reasonable lawyers’ fees. All bank charges or
                conversion fees that result from the wiring of fees or use of
                credit cards will be incurred by the Customer.
              </p>

              <p>
                5.3 If Customer does not pay any fees when due, WeStore will
                inform Warehouse, and Warehouse may immediately stop Storage and
                Delivery Services and pursue any other remedy available at law
                (which may include selling or destroying the goods being stored
                after a period of 90 days).
              </p>

              <p>
                5.4 Any cash on delivery (COD) collected by a Warehouse or other
                delivery service providers will be remitted every 2 weeks by
                WeStore to the Customer’s bank account provided to WeStore upon
                registration.
              </p>

              <p>
                5.5 Customer will not attempt to bypass the payment mechanisms
                of WeStore, including by arranging for payment directly with the
                Warehouse or through any other channels than WeStore.
              </p>

              <p>
                5.6 Each party will be responsible for collecting, reporting,
                and payment of all taxes to the proper authorities.
              </p>

              <p>6. Term and Termination</p>

              <p>
                6.1 These Terms will begin upon your acceptance and continue
                until terminated by either party with 60 days’ prior written
                notice to the other party, or if WeStore immediately terminates
                your account per Clause 2.6.
              </p>

              <p>
                6.2 If terminated for any reason, WeStore will cancel your
                access to your account. If a Customer has already booked a
                Warehouse’s Storage and Delivery Services prior to cancellation
                of the account, Customer must continue to pay WeStore for all
                such services and these Terms will remain in effect.
              </p>

              <p>
                6.3 WeStore is under no obligation to grant refunds for Storage
                and Delivery Services paid for in advance, but may do so if it
                decides.
              </p>

              <p>7. Third-Party Sites or Services</p>

              <p>
                7.1 WeStore may give you access to third-party sites or services
                through hyperlinks, API or other means. You should review the
                third-party terms and conditions, as WeStore has no control over
                and does not monitor such sites. WeStore will not be liable to
                you for the content of these sites or your use of them.
              </p>

              <p>
                7.2 WeStore may offer you third-party services, such as delivery
                services. These services may be subject to a separate agreement
                between you and the service provider. Under no circumstances
                will WeStore be liable to you for the use of such services.
              </p>

              <p>
                7.3 Third-party services may be subject to separate fees. You
                will be informed of such fees prior to the performance of the
                services.
              </p>

              <p>8. Liability and Indemnification</p>

              <p>
                8.1 The Services provided by WeStore are provided “as is”, “as
                available” and “with all faults”, and all warranties are
                excluded.
              </p>

              <p>
                8.2 In this Clause 8, “Third Party” includes any person except
                for any affiliate, director, officer, employee or other
                personnel of Customer or WeStore.
              </p>

                (“Non-Affected Party”) by the Event as soon as reasonably able.
                The Notice must specify the cause of the Event, the scope of the
                obligations affected and a good faith estimate of the time
                required to restore full performance. Except for those
                obligations identified in the Notice, the Affected Party will
                not be relieved of its responsibility to fully perform all other
                obligations in this Agreement.

                overcome or minimize the effects of the Event as quickly as

                any reasonably-requested assistance to the Affected Party.
              </p>

              <p>
                10.4 If the Event continues for a period of more than 60 days
                from the date of the Notice, the Non-Affected Party will be
                entitled, at its sole discretion, to terminate the Agreement.
